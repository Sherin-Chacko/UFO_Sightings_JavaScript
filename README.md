JavaScript

## 1) OVERVIEW: 

The request from a client is to display a table organizing UFO data stored as a JavaScript array. The client would like to filter the table by multiple criteria creating a dynamic website. The table is created using JavaScript, while HTML/CSS and Bootstrap is used to modify the aesthetics of the website.

PURPOSE:

* To build and deploy JavaScript functions.
* To Convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions.
* To Build and deploy forEach (JavaScript for loop).
* To Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML

## 2) RESULTS:

## 3) DRAWBACK: 
When selecting the criteria for the filter, only lower case is acceptable. The filter does not work successfully if the criteria is mentioned in capital letters.

## 4) RECOMMENDATIONS: 
      A) The filter function should be changed to accomodate lower and upper case letters as well. 
      B) The filter function should include date to be represented in months also. Typing 1/2010 does not yield any result.
